# Music-Library-Database-
This is a RDBMS for a Music Library created in MYSQL (I used SQLite to run it though). It contains the information of artists, songs, videos of songs and other information related to songs and their artists. You can make playlists and add/remove songs, and store it in database using SQL queries. It also stores information of users.
Fetched the data manually from wikipedia and other online repositories. 
This was a part of DBMS class project which I did in college.
